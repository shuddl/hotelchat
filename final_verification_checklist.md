## System Architecture Document

### Infrastructure Overview
```
[Provide diagram or description of the deployed architecture]
```

### Component Interactions
- **User Interface → Server**
  - Web browser communicates with Flask server via HTTP and Socket.IO
  - Dashboard updates in real-time via Socket.IO events

- **Server → Databases**
  - Flask application connects to PostgreSQL for data persistence
  - Redis is used for caching and as message broker

- **Server → External APIs**
  - OpenAI API for AI-powered responses
  - Twilio API for WhatsApp integration

### Scaling Considerations
- **Web Tier**
  - Current configuration: [x] Gunicorn workers
  - Scaling strategy: Increase worker count or instance size

- **Worker Tier**
  - Current configuration: [x] Celery workers
  - Scaling strategy: Add more workers or instances

- **Database Tier**
  - Current size: [Database plan]
  - Scaling strategy: Upgrade database plan, implement read replicas if needed

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Log Monitoring**
  - Application logs are accessible via Render dashboard
  - Critical errors trigger notifications

- **Performance Monitoring**
  - Resource usage is monitored via Render dashboard
  - Custom performance metrics are logged to [service name]

- **Alerting Rules**
  - Error rate exceeds [threshold]
  - Response time exceeds [threshold]
  - Memory usage exceeds [threshold]

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance
- **Database Maintenance**
  - Review and optimize slow queries monthly
  - Check for database growth and plan accordingly

- **Cache Management**
  - Monitor Redis memory usage
  - Review cache hit/miss rates

- **Log Management**
  - Rotate logs according to retention policy
  - Archive important logs for compliance if needed

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues and Resolutions

**Issue: OpenAI API errors**
- Check OpenAI service status at https://status.openai.com/
- Verify API key is valid and has sufficient quota
- Review error logs for specific error types
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

**Issue: Socket.IO connection failures**
- Check if client can reach the WebSocket endpoint
- Verify proxy/load balancer is configured for WebSockets
- Check for client-side network issues
- Review Socket.IO server logs for connection errors

**Issue: Database connection errors**
- Verify database service is running
- Check connection pool settings
- Review database logs for errors
- Check network connectivity between app and database

**Issue: High CPU or memory usage**
- Review application logs for potential infinite loops
- Check for memory leaks in long-running processes
- Review database query optimization
- Consider scaling up instance size temporarily

## Future Improvements

### Short-term Improvements
- Implement better error tracking and reporting
- Add more comprehensive monitoring dashboards
- Optimize database queries for frequently accessed data
- Implement additional caching strategies

### Long-term Roadmap
- Consider migrating to a more scalable architecture
- Implement blue/green deployment capability
- Add automated testing to CI/CD pipeline
- Explore multi-region deployment for redundancy
