# Hotel Chatbot Remediation Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. chat_server.py

1. **Replaced AsyncOpenAI with synchronous OpenAI client**
   - Changed `openai_client = AsyncOpenAI()` to `openai_client = OpenAI()`
   - Removed the `asyncio.Semaphore` for concurrency control as it's no longer needed

2. **Created new synchronous function `get_ai_response`**
   - Replaces both `ai_respond_sync` and `async def ai_respond`
   - Directly calls the synchronous OpenAI API via `openai_client.chat.completions.create()`
   - Maintains the same parameter interface and return values for compatibility
   - Includes the same error handling and logging as the original functions

3. **Removed asyncio-related code**
   - Eliminated the need for `asyncio.new_event_loop()` and `loop.run_until_complete()`
   - Removed the `async def ai_respond` function that was causing the gevent conflict

### 2. tasks.py

1. **Updated import statement**
   - Changed `from chat_server import ai_respond_sync` to `from chat_server import get_ai_response`

2. **Updated function call**
   - Changed `ai_reply, detected_intent, handoff_triggered = ai_respond_sync(...)` to `ai_reply, detected_intent, handoff_triggered = get_ai_response(...)`
   - Parameters remain the same for compatibility

### 3. render.yaml

1. **Updated worker configuration**
   - Changed `startCommand` from:
     ```
     gunicorn chat_server:app --worker-class geventwebsocket.gunicorn.workers.GeventWebSocketWorker --config gunicorn.conf.py
     ```
     to:
     ```
     gunicorn -k gevent -w 4 chat_server:app --config gunicorn.conf.py
     ```
   - Uses the standard `gevent` worker class which is recommended for Flask-SocketIO applications

### 4. requirements.txt

1. **Removed unused dependency**
   - Removed `eventlet==0.39.0` as it was unused and could cause conflicts with gevent

## Implementation Steps

1. Apply the changes to `chat_server.py`:
   - Replace the AsyncOpenAI client with synchronous OpenAI
   - Add the new `get_ai_response` function
   - Remove the `ai_respond` async function and `ai_respond_sync` function

2. Update `tasks.py` to import and use `get_ai_response` instead of `ai_respond_sync`

3. Replace `render.yaml` with the updated version using the standard gevent worker

4. Update `requirements.txt` to remove eventlet

5. Deploy the changes to Render.com

## Expected Results

The changes will resolve the asyncio/gevent conflict that was causing the AI responses to fail and the live messages to stop updating. The application should now:

1. Successfully generate AI responses to user messages
2. Display real-time updates on the agent dashboard
3. Process incoming WhatsApp messages correctly
4. Maintain all existing functionality without introducing new issues

## Verification Steps

1. Test sending a WhatsApp message to the bot and verify it responds
2. Check the "Live Messages" dashboard to ensure messages appear in real-time
3. Test AI response handling for various message types
4. Verify handoff functionality works when a user requests to speak to a human
5. Monitor application logs for any errors related to OpenAI API calls
6. Check server performance metrics to ensure stability under load
